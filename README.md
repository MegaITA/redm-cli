# RedM-CLI

This is a simple but helpful tool to help developers like me to speed up their creation process. One thing I always hated was creating the same folder and fxmanifest structure over and over again, copy pasting was not a valid solution for me so I decided to build something simple but effective.

## Getting Started

The installation process is dead simple. First of all you need to install it globally, so you can call it from anywhere, just type in your terminal:
```
npm i -g redm-cli
```

Done. You can now use the tool by entering the following command in your terminal, be sure to be in the right folder!
```
redm-cli
```

Follow the steps, and you're done!
